Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step

Game Idea: Snake


Game Rules: The player has to keep the snake, which is automatically moving, inside of the box. They will only be able to control when it turns. The snake has to collect items to get a higher score. Also, the snake gets longer with every item it collects, which makes it more challenging as the game progresses.


Major Game Elements: The player will control the snake stats, and there will be obstacles that randomly spawn throughout the game. Items give you a higher score and make the snake longer.
